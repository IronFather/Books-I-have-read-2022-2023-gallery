This is a gallery of books, that I have read during 2022 - 2023 years.

Reading books I focused on three directions:
1) UX/UI Design.
2) Self-education (soft skills);
3) Self-discipline and habits;


I made the gallery using:
1) SimpleLightbox library
2) squoosh.app for optimization images;
3) Animista for title
