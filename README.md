This is a gallery of books, that I have read during 2022 year.

Reading books I focused on three directions:
1) IT-education (soft skills);
2) Self-discipline and habits;
3) Hobby (triathlon).

I made the gallery using:
1) SimpleLightbox library
2) squoosh.app for optimization images;
3) Animista for title
